The focus of this module is on SageMaker's built-in algorithms. These algorithms are ready-to-use, scalable, and provide many other conveniences. The module shows how to use SageMaker's built-in algorithms via hosted Jupyter notebooks, the AWS CLI, and the SageMaker console. You'll also see different strategies to distribute your data when training your models across a cluster of machines. To proceed to this module you need to have completed the [Cloud9 Setup](../prerequisites/cloud9.html) and [Creating a Notebook Instance](../introduction/notebook.html) sections in the previous module.
